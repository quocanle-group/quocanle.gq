## Hasebe Haruka's Monologue

When i evaluate myself, I consider myself a bad person. Everyone has done something once or twice that they were told 'not to do'.

For example, ignoring a red traffic light. Even if you didn't have any malicious intentions, you probably have some experience with that sort of

thing. Another example is accepting the wrong amount of change at the checkout and not giving it back. When a clerk mistakenly gives you more than what is owed, whether it's one yen or ten, people often walk away with it.

Spitting on the side of the road or littering on the street. It may seem like a small thing, but it also falls under the category of a crime.

I wouldn't consider myself a "bad person" just because of things like these. I'm...

It could seem trivial from someone else's point of view. But I dragged my past with me all the way to high school and decided I wouldn't make any new friends. I believed I would be perfectly content if I distanced myself from everyone and entered a world where I wasn't connected with anyone. That's why, when I learned about Advanced Nurturing High School, I thought this school would be able to give me what I wanted.

Before I even realized it, I had made friends again. Kiyopon, Yukimū, Miyachi and... Airi.

I was able to get back the feeling of being youthful. At least, that's what I had believed. Out of nowhere, that feeling was once again stolen from me within a single day.

Who stole it? That's obvious.

Horikita Suzune and Ayanokōji Kiyotaka.

I became a victim of the selfish actions of those two people. I can't forgive them. There's no way I can.

And so...

I decided to get revenge.
