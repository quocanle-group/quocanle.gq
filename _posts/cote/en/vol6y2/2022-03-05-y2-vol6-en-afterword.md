**Afterword**

Long-time no see, or nice to meet you. I'm Shōgō Kinusaga. This is a serious postcard.

I hope you have already noticed this but after 5 years, YouZitsu sequel anime has been produced and will be broadcasted.

Although the story is almost impossible to put it into words, I can say a lot of hard work and suffering that went into the making of this announcement.

More than once, I almost stopped writing. I thought I might not be able to turn it into an anime again. I was anxious like that. However, the reason why I have been able to continue writing this book without stopping until today is because many readers have supported me, even after the anime finished airing in 2017.

Without this long and significant achievement, the re-animation would never have been realized.

As an author, I have never been so happy and grateful for a sequel decision. Thank you very, very, very much.

And let me say this strongly.

I have been waiting for YouZitsu's sequel to be made into an anime more than anyone else for a long, long time.

It was roughly two years ago that we started to talk about this.

I was so excited! But it was a short time before the global virus took its toll on us.

Anyway, I would like to rejoice that the announcement has been successfully made.

We will do our best to connect the anime to the story.

There is still more to tell, but this is the end of this postcard.

It's been a long time coming, but I'm looking forward to seeing the growth of Ayanokōji and the others again. Can't you just run the anime until it's finished? Woo! Woo!

That's it for now... YEAHHHHHH!!!! YAY!!!!! Thank you all for your continued support!!!!
