Diary Entry 1:

One of the most impactful learning experiences I had in my life was when I failed an important exam in high school. I had studied hard for it, but I did not manage my time well and I panicked during the test. I felt so disappointed when I saw my low score. However, instead of giving up, I decided to learn from my mistake and improve my study skills. I asked for feedback from my teacher, I joined a study group with my classmates. I improved my grades and confidence in the next exams. This experience taught me that failure is not the end, but an opportunity to grow and learn.

Diary Entry 2:

Last year, I decided to enroll in an online course on artificial intelligence. I was always interested in this topic, but I did not have much background knowledge or experience in it. I hoped that taking this course would be a good way to learn something new and expand my knowledge. I learned a lot from this course, not only about the basics of artificial intelligence, but also about how it can be applied to various domains and contexts, such as education, health care, business. This learning experience helped me develop some of the skills and competencies that are relevant for this course, such as curiosity, creativity, innovation, adaptability, and lifelong learning.
