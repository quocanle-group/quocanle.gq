Before starting the personal SWOT analysis, you need to define your aspirations as a leader, because the assessment you are conducting will be specifically linked to these objectives.

Where do you see yourself in 5, 10 or 20 years? Close your eyes and imagine yourself...

What leadership style matches your core values? Exemplary leadership? Emerging leadership? What leader do you want to be?

**Strengths:**

-   What are you good at?

-   Which are the aspects of your skills that set you aside from others?

-   Which achievements are you mostly proud of?

-   Which soft skills set you aside? Are you a good listener? Are you a great communicator? Do your fellow students trust you?

-   What values set you aside from your peers?

-   What do you like to do? What makes you happy in your studies and in your personal life?
