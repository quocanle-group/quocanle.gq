Early in the morning, our team met at the beach and was assigned a section of the beach to clean. We were all given gloves, trash bags. As we worked, we chatted and laughed, enjoying that time while also doing something good for the environment. The sun was shining, and the sound of the waves made that morning so beautiful.

We worked for an hour, and by the end of the time, we had filled up several trash bags. It was amazing to see how much of a difference we could make in such a short amount of time. I learned about the different types of pollution that can harm the environment, and how we can all do our part to reduce our impact. I realized that even small actions, like picking up a piece of trash, can make a big difference.

After we finished cleaning up our sections of the beach, we gathered together to take a group photo and celebrate our accomplishment. We talked about how satisfying it was to see the beach looking so much cleaner than it had been before we started.

Overall, I had a great experience participating in the Giving Project. Not only did I get to spend time with my friends and colleagues, but I also got to do something meaningful for the environment. I learned a lot about the importance of environmental stewardship and how even small actions can have a big impact.
